This is the frontend implementation of a food-ordering platform, designed to provide users with an intuitive and seamless experience for browsing, selecting, and ordering food. Built with React and modern JavaScript technologies, this project emphasizes user engagement, interactivity, and performance. Users can search for food items, add them to their cart, modify quantities, and remove items. The cart is managed persistently using localStorage, ensuring data is retained even after page reloads. In the case of no search results, a custom "Not Found" page is displayed. The platform offers real-time updates of total prices and item counts for a dynamic and smooth ordering experience.
